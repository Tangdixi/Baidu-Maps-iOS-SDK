#This repo is deprecated
==================

I change the download source to **Baidu Offical Download**. So this repo, which is a mirror for **Baidu-Maps-iOS-SDK** will be deprecated.

A new spec has already created in the CocoaPods/Spec, also fix the arm64 and Objective-C++ compile source problems. You don't need to have any file with a *.mm* suffix or change the compile source to **Objective-C++**
